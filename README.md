# Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office

This dataset contains more than 8,500 Netflix movies and TV shows, including cast members, duration, and genre. It contains titles added as recently as late September 2021.

Challenges are brief:

   - 🗺️ Explore: How much variety exists in Netflix's offering? Base this on three variables: type, country, and listed_in.
   - 📊 Visualize: Build a word cloud from the movie and TV shows descriptions. Make sure to remove stop words!
   - 🔎 Analyze: Has Netflix invested more in certain genres (see listed_in) in recent years? What about certain age groups (see ratings)?

This project is part of the DataCamp data scientist training path.
